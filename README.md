# ResearchDev
In this `ResearchDev` repository, I would like to share threat detection insights throughout Microsoft Defender XDR.

- [x] Microsoft Defender XDR effectively captures all suspicious activities across email, endpoint, identity and application.
- [x] Microsoft Defender XDR correlates alerts from different defenders into a single incident.
      This holistic view enhances the capabilities of SOC personnel for comprehensive monitoring and management of security incidents.
